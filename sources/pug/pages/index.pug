					})
						p After you complete the payment via our secure form you will receive the instructions for downloading the product. The source files in the download package can vary based on the type of the product you have purchased..col-md-6
					+card({
						parentId: 'accordion1',
						title:    'What are the advantages of purchasing a template?'
					})
						p The major advantage is price: You get a high quality design for just $20-$70. You don’t have to hire a web designer or web design studio. Second advantage is time frame.
					+card({
						parentId: 'accordion1',
						title:    'What is a unique/non-unique purchase?'
					})
						p Non-exclusive purchase means that other people can buy the template you have chosen some time later. Exclusive or unique purchase guarantees that you are the last person to buy this template as well as:
						ul.list-marked
							li The template gets removed from our catalog;
							li It won’t be available to new customers;
							li It will be available to you and previous clients.
						p These types of purchases allow you to decide what you want for your website. No matter your decision, our templates will provide great design for you.
